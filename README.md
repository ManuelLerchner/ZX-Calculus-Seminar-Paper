# ZX-Calculus Seminar Paper

This repository contains my seminar paper and presentation materials for the `Applications of Quantum Computing in IT Security` seminar conducted at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). The paper and slides provide an introductory exploration of the ZX-Calculus, a powerful graphical formalism for quantum computing quantum circuit simplifcation.

## Abstract

ZX-Calculus is a graphical language that extends classical quantum circuits by replacing the logic gates with more
fundamental building blocks. Those building blocks are called spiders and are represented by colored nodes in a graph. Together
with edges connecting those nodes, they form a ZX diagram. A set of rewrite rules allows to perform transformations and
simplifications on those ZX diagrams. ZX-Calculus promises a more intuitive way of reasoning about quantum circuits, as there
are fewer rewrite rules to remember than in the classical logic gate model. In this paper I will introduce the ZX-Calculus, its
rewrite rules, and some of its applications. I will give a particular focus on optimizing quantum circuits, as this is one of the main
applications of the ZX-Calculus.
