# ZX-Calculus

# Introduction

ZX-Calculus is a graphical language for quantum computing. It is based on the mathematical model of Tensornetworks and Category Theory.
It works by encoding quantum circuits as graphs, which consist of nodes ("spiders") and edges "lines". Nodes represent quantum gates and edges represent the path qubits and information move.

## Use Cases

+ Compilation of quantum circuits (What exactly?)
+ Circuit optimization

## ZX-Notation

The ZX-Notation is very concise, it basically consist only of two elements: spiders and lines.

# T-Count Optimization
