    abstract = {We present novel laws describing the interaction of a pair of mutually unbiased observables. These laws yield a diagrammatic calculus which enables matrix-free reasoning about quantum systems. To illustrate the elegance of this approach we establish some properties of standard quantum logic gates, compute the quantum Fourier transform and demonstrate equivalence between certain cluster state and quantum circuit computations.

Historical note: First paper containing ZX-diagrams. Rejected from QIP with reports like: ``nice pictures, so what?''.}
