\section{Conclusion}

We have seen that ZX calculus is a powerful tool for reasoning about quantum circuits and offers new ways to simplify quantum circuits and reason about quantum algorithms.
By relying on a graphical language, which is very intuitive and easy to use,
ZX calculus is a handy tool for teaching quantum computing and quantum algorithms.

ZX calculus is still a rather new field of research and remains very active as there are still many open questions left to answer. Research in this field promises to provide new insights into efficient quantum algorithms and quantum computing in general.
