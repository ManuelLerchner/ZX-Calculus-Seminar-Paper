\section{Conclusion}

We have seen that ZX-calculus is a powerful tool for reasoning about quantum circuits. We have seen that it offers new ways to simplify and calculate quantum circuits by relying on a graphical language, which is very intuitive and easy to use. ZX-calculus is a very active field of research and that there are still many open questions left to answer.

One of the ongoing areas of research in ZX-calculus is the development of efficient extraction algorithm which are needed in order to gain back a classical gate representation of the circuit. Since ZX-Calculus is a very new field of research, there is still huge potential for new discoveries and applications.
