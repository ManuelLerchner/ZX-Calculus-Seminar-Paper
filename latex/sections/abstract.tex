    ZX-Calculus is a graphical language which extends classical quantum circuits by splitting up logic gates into even smaller building blocks. Those building blocks are called spiders and are represented by colored nodes in a graph. Together with edges connecting those nodes, they form a ZX-diagram. Using a set of rewrite rules, ZX-diagrams can be transformed into each other. This allows for a more intuitive way of reasoning about the optimization of quantum circuits, as there are fewer rewrite rules to remember than in the classical logic gate model. In this paper, I will introduce the ZX-Calculus and its rewrite rules, as well as some of its applications. I will give a special focus on the optimization of quantum circuits, as this is one of the main applications of the ZX-Calculus.
